Map

Map image was messed up because I forgot to add "px" when setting height and width

imgObj not showing up on map
	- fixed by setting tile z-index to -1
imgObj not moving from 0,0 
	- set position to absolute
imgObj not infront of titan
	- remove z-index -1 from map, and apply only to tiles
barrierList entry not picked up by character during update
	- logged barrier list to see contents
	- add offset when applying imgobj barrier list to map barrier list
barrierList of boxes weren't picked up by a character
	- function creating the map didn't return map, so character didn't recieve it.
	- discovered this by attaching an else statement to the barrier check in character
